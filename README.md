# JSON-Compiler
This project presents a complete implementation of a JASON compiler in Python. The JASON language, which is case-insensitive, incorporates keywords, operators, and various statements to facilitate programming tasks. The project encompasses two phases: building a scanner (lexical analysis) and writing a parser (syntax analysis) for the language.
